## Review Summary

**Spartan-ecdsa**

Spartan-ecdsa is a library for proving and verifying ECDSA (secp256k1) signatures in zero-knowledge. Group membership proving time is 10x faster in Spartan-ecdsa compared to [efficient-zk-ecdsa](https://github.com/personaelabs/efficient-zk-ecdsa), the previous implemenation by Personae Labs. It is developed using the [Spartan](https://github.com/microsoft/Spartan) proof system which does not require trusted setup. However, Spartan uses `secp256k1` curve intead of `curve25519-dalek` in Spartan.

The Spartan-ecdsa circuits, commit [3386b30d9b](https://github.com/personaelabs/spartan-ecdsa/tree/3386b30d9b5b62d8a60735cbeab42bfe42e80429), were reviewed by 13 auditors between June 19, 2023 and July 5, 2023.

## Scope

The scope of the review consisted of the following circuits at commit [3386b30d9b](https://github.com/personaelabs/spartan-ecdsa/tree/3386b30d9b5b62d8a60735cbeab42bfe42e80429):

- eff_ecdsa.circom
- tree.circom
- add.circom
- double.circom
- mul.circom
- poseidon.circom
- pubkey_membership.circom

After the findings were presented to the Spartan-ecdsa team, fixes were made and included in several PRs.

This review is for identifying potential vulnerabilities in the code. The reviewers did not investigate security practices or operational security and assumed that privileged accounts could be trusted. The reviewers did not evaluate the security of the code relative to a standard or specification. The review may not have identified all potential attack vectors or areas of vulnerability.

Electisec and the auditors make no warranties regarding the security of the code and do not warrant that the code is free from defects. Electisec and the auditors do not represent nor imply to third parties that the code has been audited nor that the code is free from defects. By deploying or using the code, Spartan-ecdsa and users of the circuits agree to use the code at their own risk.

| Access Control           | N/A     | Spartan-ecdsa is a permissionless protocol, and as such no access control is required                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Mathematics              | Good    | Sage scripts were created to assess the security of some parameters used in the algorithms                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Complexity               | High    | Complexity is reduced compared to previous implementations due to doing right-field arithmetic on secq and eliminating SNARK-unfriendly range checks and big integer math. This led to an overall reduction of R1CS constraints from 1.5M to ~5k.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Libraries                | Average | Well-known libraries such as circomlib are used, but [Poseidon](https://www.poseidon-hash.info) was custom-implemented with Spartan-ecdsa's own constants since the finite field that Spartan uses isn't supported                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Decentralization         | Good    | Spartan-ecdsa is a permissionless protocol                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Cryptography             | Good    | Spartan-ecdsa operates on the `secp256k1` curve which provides a security level of `128 bits`. It makes use of the Poseidon hash function known for its zk-friendlinesss, simplicity, and resistance against various cryptanalytic attacks. However, it's essential to note that cryptographic algorithms and functions are always subject to ongoing analysis, and new attacks or weaknesses may be discovered in the future.                                                         |
| Code stability           | Average | The code was reviewed at a specific commit. The code did not change during the review. However, due to its focus on efficiency, it is likely to change with the addition of features or updates, or to achieve further performance gains.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

It is recommended to aggregate the resources necessary of the protocol under a single repository |
| Monitoring               | N/A     | The protocol is intended to be integrated by a dApps who will be responsible for any monitoring needed                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Testing and verification | Low     | The protocol contains only a few tests for the circuits. During audit, the [circom-mutator](https://github.com/aviggiano/circom-mutator) testing tool was developed for finding potential blind spots in the test coverage of circom projects. The `circom-mutator` tool found that several edge cases were not tested by the project. It is recommended to add more tests to increase test coverage                                                                                   |

## Findings Explanation

Findings are broken down into sections by their respective Impact:

- Critical, High, Medium, Low Impact
  - These are findings that range from attacks that may cause loss of funds, proof malleability, or cause any unintended consequences/actions that are outside the scope of the requirements
- Informational
  - Findings including Recommendations and best practices

---

## Critical Findings

None.

## High Findings

### 1. High - Input signal s is not constrained in eff_ecdsa.circom

It is possible to submit `s = 0`, `Ux = pubX`, `Uy = pubY` or `s = 0`, `Ux = pubX`, `Uy = -pubY` and get back `(pubX, pubY)`, though this is not a valid signature.

#### Technical Details

Given check $\ s \* T + U == pubKey\$ ,

```math
s * T + U == pubKey
```

```math
s = 0 ,  \forall  T  \in secp256k1
```

```math
s * T + U = 0 * T + U = O + U = U == pubKey
```

```math
or
```

```math
T = 0 , \forall s \in secp256k1
```

```math
s * T + U = s * 0 + U = O + U = U == pubKey
```

where `U = (pubX, pubY)`. -U would work as well, where `-U = (pubX, -pubY)`. Here is a [POC](https://gist.github.com/igorline/c45c0fb84c943d1f641c82a20c02c21e#file-addr_membership-test-ts-L60-L66) to explain the same.

#### Impact

High. The missing constraints can be used to generate fake proof.

#### Recommendation

Add the constraints to the circuit and/or documentation

#### Developer Response

Acknowledged

### 2. High - Knowledge of any member signature allow to generate proof of membership

Knowledge of any valid signature by an account stored in the merkle tree allows generating membership proof

#### Technical Details

There is no check on message supplied by the user. Anyone can submit valid past signatures with arbitrary message hash

#### Impact

High. The missing constraints can be used to generate fake proof.

#### Recommendation

Add the constraints to the circuit and/or documentation

#### Developer Response

Acknowledged

Reported by [Antonio Viggiano](https://github.com/aviggiano), [Igor Line](https://github.com/igorline), [Oba](https://github.com/obatirou)

### 3. High - Under constrained circuits compromising the soundness of the system

In the file [mul.circom](https://github.com/electisec/spartan-ecdsa/blob/main/packages/circuits/eff_ecdsa_membership/secp256k1/mul.circom), the signals `slo` & `shi` are assigned but not constrained.

#### Technical Details

```
    signal slo <-- s & (2  (128) - 1);
    signal shi <-- s >> 128;
```

#### Impact

High. Underconstraining allows malicious provers to generate fake proofs.

#### Developer Response

> Adding the line `slo + shi * 2  128 === s;` would fix this, but it turns out that actually, that calculation of `k = (s + tQ) % q` doesn't have to be constrained at all (so the entire template K is unnecessary). Regardless, your discovery made me realize K is unnecessary, which results in solid constraint count reduction!

Reported by [nullity](https://github.com/nullity00)

### 4. High - X, Y pair may be an invalid point on the curve

Circuits do not check whether the point $(x,y)$ is on the curve $E$.

#### Technical Details

The pair $(x,y)$ forms a group $G$ of order $N$ under $E(\mathbb{F}_p)/\mathcal{P}$ where $E$ 
  represents an elliptic curve, $x, y < P$, $\mathbb{F}_p$ denotes a finite field, and $\mathcal{P}$
  represents the prime order of the base point. There is no check validating that $(x,y)$ $\in$ $G$.

#### Impact

User may provide a public key (which is just a point $`(x,y)`$) that is not a valid point on the curve. This may leak the private key if the point is chosen from small order $N'$ of another curve $C'$

#### Recommendation

Validate the given point $(x,y)$ outside of the circuit.

#### Developer Response

Acknowledged

## Medium Findings

None.

## Low Findings

### 1. Low - Unchecked edge case in complete addition

`Secp256k1AddComplete()` returns an incorrect value when `yP + yQ = 1`.

#### Technical Details

`zeroizeA.out` should be 0 when `P` and `Q` are different points, but when `xP != xQ` and `yP + yQ = 1` it would be 1.

In this case the output point would be the point at infinity instead of the actual sum.

#### Impact

Low. secp256k1 arithmetics is incorrect in some edge cases.

#### Recommendation

Document the proof that when $yP + yQ = 1$, the points $P$ and $Q$ either do not exist on the curve or are highly improbable to occur.

If this can't be done, then add a `isYEqual` component as done for `X` and use `AND()` instead of `IsEqual()`

```
    component zeroizeA = AND();
    zeroizeA.in[0] <== isXEqual.out;
    zeroizeA.in[1] <== isYEqual.out;
```

There should be similar informational warnings to the client implementations for many edge cases like zero point, points at infinity, additions/multiplications with $p$ & $-p$

## Informational Findings

### 1. Informational - Over-allocation of circom components

In [mul.circom:Secp256k1Mul](https://github.com/electisec/spartan-ecdsa/blob/main/packages/circuits/eff_ecdsa_membership/secp256k1/mul.circom), the value `accIncomplete` and `PComplete` are over-allocated.

#### Technical Details

In [mul.circom:Secp256k1Mul](https://github.com/electisec/spartan-ecdsa/blob/main/packages/circuits/eff_ecdsa_membership/secp256k1/mul.circom), the value `accIncomplete` and `PComplete` are over-allocated.

```
    component accIncomplete[bits];
    // ...
    component PComplete[bits-3];
```

#### Impact

Optimization.

#### Recommendation

Reduce the allocation of these component arrays to `accIncomplete[bits-p3]` and `PIncomplete[3]`.

#### Developer Response

Acknowledged

### 2. Informational - Check if the input scalar is within the valid range

#### Technical Details

Add assertions and constraints to check for invalid inputs and edge cases

#### Impact

Informational.

#### Recommendation

Add a constraint to ensure that the input scalar is within the valid range of the secp256k1 elliptic curve. You can do this by adding an assertion to check if the scalar is less than the curve's order.

```
// Add this line after the signal input scalar declaration
assert(scalar < 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFEBAAEDCE6AF48A03BBFD25E8CD0364141);
```

#### Developer Response

Acknowledged

Reported by [0xnagu](https://github.com/thogiti)

### 3. Informational - Unused value `bits`

#### Technical Details

In `eff_ecdsa.circom`, the value `bits` is assigned but never read.

#### Impact

Informational.

#### Recommendation

Remove the unused value.

#### Developer Response

Acknowledged

Reported by [Antonio Viggiano](https://github.com/aviggiano), [Igor Line](https://github.com/igorline), [Oba](https://github.com/obatirou), [garfam](https://github.com/gafram), [parsley](https://github.com/bbresearcher), [Bahurum](https://github.com/bahurum), [lwltea](https://github.com/lwltea)

### 4. Informational - No constraints on input signals

#### Technical Details

There are no constraints on input signals in any of the circuits (presumably to reduce the number of constraints to a bare minimum). This could potentially cause issues for third party developers integrating Spartan-ECDSA.

#### Impact

Informational.

#### Recommendation

In order to keep the number of constraints to a minimum, simply document the absence of input signal constraints clearly and suggest that they be validated in the application code.

#### Developer Response

Acknowledged

Reported by [whoismatthewmc](https://github.com/whoismatthewmc1)

### 5. Informational - Missing & Extra Imports in `eff_ecdsa.circom`

#### Technical Details

The `add.circom` import is missing in `eff_ecdsa.circom`. The `bitify.circom` is imported in `eff_ecdsa.circom` but not used.

#### Impact

Informational. This is not an issue as `add.circom` is imported in `mul.circom` which is in turn imported in `eff_ecdsa.circom`.

#### Recommendation

But recommendation is to explicitly import like `include "./secp256k1/add.circom";` & remove `bitify.circom` import.

#### Developer Response

Acknowledged

Reported by [lwltea](https://github.com/lwltea), [Vincent Owen](https://github.com/makluganteng)

### 6. Informational - Constraints for add.cicom for values to be non-zero

In signal assignments containing division, the divisor needs to be constrained to be non-zero.

#### Technical Details

```
   │
31 │     lambda <-- dy / dx;
   │                     ^^ The divisor `dx` must be constrained to be non-zero.
```

#### Impact

Informational.

#### Recommendation

Do an additional check for non-zero values.

#### Developer Response

Acknowledged

Reported by [Chen Wen Kang](https://github.com/cwkang1998), [Vincent Owen](https://github.com/makluganteng)

#### 7. Informational - More tests for the circuits

Additional tests are always good to have in order to cover more unexpected cases.

#### Technical Details

`eff_ecdsa.test.ts` and `eff_ecdsa_to_addr.test.ts` only have 1 positive tests.

#### Impact

## Final remarks

- The Spartan-ecdsa circuits assume that the underlying hash function (Poseidon) is:
  - Collision-resistant
  - Resistant to differential, algebraic, and interpolation attacks
  - Behaves as a random oracle
- The Merkle tree used for membership proof is assumed to be secure against second-preimage attacks.
- Social engineering attacks are still a valid way to break the system.
  ECDSA has several nonce based attacks. It is very important that the client side confirguration doesn't leak any nonce data or any app metadata that can reduce the security of guessing nonce for the ECDSA.
- We recommend clarifying the proper usage of each template, where assertions about the valuation of its inputs (pre-conditions) should be satisfied when calling the template.
- We recommend writing a checklist to be ensured on the client side. This can help dApp developers avoid common mistakes such as missing validation of inputs which can lead to soundness bugs.
- Overall, the code demonstrates good implementation of mathematical operations and basic functionality. However, it could benefit from more documentation and tests.

## Automated program analysis tools

Over the course of the audit, in addition to a manual review of the code, we applied different automated program analysis tools and evaluated their output.

1. [circomspect](#1-circomspect)
2. [Picus](#2-picus)
3. [Ecne](#3-ecne)
4. [circom-mutator](#4-circom-mutator)

A few things to note on results from Picus and Ecne:

- Ecne can output false positive. It relies on static analysis but [does not](https://discord.com/channels/877252171983360072/1125118979065782456/1125286705377837206) call an SMT solver to concretely find the potential attack vector.
- Picus does not output false positive. Its produces one of the following outputs:
  `safe`: Picus did not find underconstrained bugs
  `unsafe`: Picus found an underconstrained bug. It may also output the attack vector.
  `unknown`: Picus cannot get a result within the given time limit. Manual review is necessary. The time limit for the solver can also be increased.
- Note that two solvers that use different theories are available for Picus: z3 and cvc5. Picus and some of its libraries are still in development and could cointain bugs. In case of conflicting results, `safe` for one and `unsafe` for the other, the only way to know which one is correct would be to manually verify the counter example produced by the solver that reported `unsafe`.

### 4. Circom-Mutator

The [circom-mutator](https://github.com/aviggiano/circom-mutator) was developed during the review. It intended to help find blind spots in the test coverage of circom projects.

`circom-mutator` works by injecting bugs into existing code in order to generate "mutants". The output is then compared with that of existing tests. Mutanted circuits should ideally make tests fail. In many cases, an injected bug will not necessarily mean that the circuit is vulnerable, but rather that the test coverage can be improved, or that the circuit accepts these edge cases but proper validation should be performed elsewhere (such as in the application layer).

The tool can be used either as a CLI (`npx circom-mutator <file>`) or by adding it to the project and calling the `testMutations` helper function on the jest test files.
